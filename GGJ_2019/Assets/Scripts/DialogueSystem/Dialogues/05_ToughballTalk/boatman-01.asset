  diaglogue:
  - Who the hell are you?
  - I am here to get you out.
  - Hahaha. Oh, that's cute. And how do you convince the mayor of your plan?
  - Let's see. Did you really beat up the priest?
  - I... well... yeah. I did. And what can I say, I'm sorry. I really am. I was just
    so angry.
  - Still no reason to beat up people, though.
  - Yeah, yeah, you're right, okay? I overreacted. Things weren't so good between
    me and the store keeper, anyway. But how can i explain that to the mayor?
  - Don't you have something that shows how important you are for the village?
  - Well... with my last shipment, I brought home a huge pile of coffee. You should
    find it next to my house.
  - Coffee?
  - The best I ever had. The mayor and the policeman are crazy about coffee. Maybe
    they can indeed be convinced.
  - Alright. I'll see what I can do.
