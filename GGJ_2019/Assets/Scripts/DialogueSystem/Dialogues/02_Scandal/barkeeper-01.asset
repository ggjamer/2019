  diaglogue:
  - Hey buddy. So, my wife told you everything about the soap opera in our village?
  - I guess so
  - She can be a real chatter box, sometimes, haha. Hey, would you mind helping me
    out here?
  - No problem. What can I do?
  - Would you help me clean the dishes? I am so sorry to ask you for that, but
    the bar opens soon and I'm really behind.
  - Sure!
  - Great. Just go over to the bar and get started. We can chat afterwards if you
    like to.
