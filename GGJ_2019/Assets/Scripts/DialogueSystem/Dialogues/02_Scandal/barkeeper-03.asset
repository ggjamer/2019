  diaglogue:
  - Oh, you are done cleaning. Great work. And, man thank you so much
  - You are welcome. Who's that weird drunk guy?
  - 'That one? Boy, I have no idea. He sits here every day and is responsible for
    half of my income, haha. '
  - I see...
  - Don't worry about him. He's just an old guy blabbering drunken nonsense. Even
    though he's right sometimes.
  - What do you mean?
  - I don't know. I heard him complaining about the ungratefulness of the villagers.
  - And he is right about it?
  - Sort of. Take the mayor for example. He sent the boatman to prison, just like
    that. After all he's done for the village.
  - The boatsman is the storekeeper's boyfriend?
  - Right, you heard about the story. Yes he is. Poor guy.
  - What made the mayor send him to prison?
  - Well... as you can imagine, he was a bit angry after hearing about his girlfriend
    and the priest. So he... kinda took care of this situation. With his fists...
  - Ouch...
  - Yeah. But relatable, if you ask me. Maybe you can talk with the mayor about this
    situation? Since the boatsman is locked away, we have a pretty huge lack of resources
    here.
