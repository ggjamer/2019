  - Well, well. If this isn't our newest villager. How may I help you?
  - You need to release the boatman.
  - How dare you! He broke the law and now he's paying for it.
  - But the whole village is suffering from the loss of resources. Which appeared
    because the boatsman can't work.
  - He needs to come up with very good arguments to make me change my mind.
