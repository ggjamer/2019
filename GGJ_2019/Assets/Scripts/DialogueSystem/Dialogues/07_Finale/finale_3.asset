  - Tell me this is not true! I would've never guessed something like that from you!
  - Please, let me explain! I just did it to revive my daddy. You have to understand!
    I need him. I'm not ready to do stuff all on my own. Really. I never meant to
    harm anyone, I just want him back.
  - Revive your daddy?!
