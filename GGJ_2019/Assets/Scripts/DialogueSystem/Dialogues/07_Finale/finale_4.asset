  - Revive me?! You guys thought I was dead. I was here all along. No need for a drama.
  - Daddy?!? You are alive. How can this be?
  - Oh honey, I guess everyone was so focused on their own business, they simply forgot
    me. Including you, my dear child.
  - Why haven't you said anything? I missed you so much.
  - See honey, I was so tired of everyone fighting about teeny tiny reasons. So I
    preffered spending my days at the barwith my gold old friend whisky. Plus, I wanted
    to see how you get along. it's time for you to stand on your own feet.
  - But... you can't just...
  - I can't? Well, guess what, I did and it seems turning out to be for good. You
    all put your arguments aside and came to a compromiss.
