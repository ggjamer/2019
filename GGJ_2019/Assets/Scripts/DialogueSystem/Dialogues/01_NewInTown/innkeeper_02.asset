  - Hi, I'm new here.
  - "Really? Wonderful! It is so great to finally see new face over here. Welcome,
    welcome! You must be exhausted. Are you hungry? I make the best mushroom pie in
    the whole village. Just give me\u2026 oh dang it. I fear, I ran completely out
    of flour. Could you run over to the grocery store and get some for me, would you
    be so sweet?"
  - Sure, no problem!
