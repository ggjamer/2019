  - ' Hi. How can I help you?'
  - Do you have some flour?
  - "Sure. My daddy used to sail up to Stonebridge to provide the finest flour. Now
    my\u2026 boyfriend\u2019s in charge for it, but he always gets the cheap flour,
    which is just not that great and\u2026 sorry, I\u2019m blabbering. Do you need
    anything else?"
  - No, thank you.
  - "You\u2019re welcome. If only my daddy was here to get some of the good flour,
    though.\n"
