  - There you are. And I see you got the flour I asked for. Great. Have you met the
    Storekeeper?
  - Yes. She is really pretty.
  - "She surely is. Yet a bit\u2026 well\u2026 simple. And she talks so much about
    her father. I think he passed away last year. At least noone has seen him since
    then. But it\u2019s clear that his daughter truly misses him. Poor thing. Her
    frustration may be the reason why she got hooked in this nasty affair\u2026"
  - Nasty affair?
  - "Yeah, it\u2019s a pretty ugly story. Apparently, the storekeeper was messing
    around with with the priest. Just imagine. The priest. You can guess that her
    boyfriend, the Boatman,  was not amused when he found out.\n"
  - 'How did he found out?

'
  - "Oh\u2026 Well\u2026 I mean\u2026 uhhm\u2026 Maybe I dropped a word or two in
    front of my husband\u2026 who maybe told the Boatman since he\u2019s his best
    friend\u2026 Yeah, I know. I should have kept this for myself. But I can\u2019t
    help it, how could I keep a secret in front of my husband?"
  - Sure. I can relate to this.
  - "Really? Oh that\u2019s so good to hear. I\u2019m glad we had the opportunity
    to chat. Are you done with the pie? No please, it\u2019s on the house. Really,
    it would be my pleasure. Was it good, though?\n"
  - 'It was delicious. Thanks and goodbye.

'
  - Goodbye. Take care, sweety.
